# RepCRec
In groups of 1 or 2, you will implement a distributed database, complete with multiversion concurrency control, deadlock detection, replication, and failure recovery. If you do this project, you will have a deep insight into the design of a distributed system. Normally, this is a multi-year, multi-person effort, but itâ€™s doable because the database is tiny.
